Query-Specific Graph Compression Using PR-Sketch
Our project focuses on graph compression using the PR-Sketch model, enhancing it with a novel approach: query-specific graph compression. Unlike traditional methods that compress graphs in a generic manner, our system dynamically compresses a graph based on the specific query a user intends to perform.

Key Features: 
User-Defined Queries – The user provides both the graph data and the specific query they want to execute.
Adaptive Compression – The system intelligently compresses the graph to optimize the execution of the given query, ensuring efficient computation and minimal storage usage.
PR-Sketch Model Foundation – We leverage the Pattern and Rank (PR) Sketch method for summarizing graph streams, improving hash space utilization and query accuracy.
Efficiency-Driven Design – The compression ensures that the essential structure relevant to the query is retained, while unnecessary details are discarded, leading to faster and more efficient query execution.
This approach ensures that users can perform complex graph queries with reduced computational overhead while maintaining accuracy and efficiency.
